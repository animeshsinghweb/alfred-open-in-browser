# Open in Browser

This is a workflow for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) forked from [JayTheMarketer/alfred-open-in-browser](https://github.com/JayTheMarketer/alfred-open-in-browser) <- [AndrewC-B/alfred-open-in-chrome](https://github.com/AndrewC-B/alfred-open-in-chrome) and extended to include Brave functionality with Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

## Usage Notes

- If Safari is either not open, or has no windows open, the workflow will post a notification saying so.

- If you'd like it to also post notifications when URLs are successfully sent to Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Edge, or Opera, just open the workflow folder (right click the workflow in Alfred and click Show in Finder) and edit the appropriate line in the respective file (they're clearly named and it's clearly marked within each file).

- The reverse behaviour is also available (i.e.: sending URLs from Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Opera/Brave to Safari).
